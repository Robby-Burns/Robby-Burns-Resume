            People often ask how I went from owning a farm and a brewery to building AI agents. To me, it was the natural next step.

          <p>
            As a farmer, I didn't just drive tractors—I architected IoT sensor networks that reduced chemical use by 40%. As a brewery owner, I didn't just pour pints—I used A/B testing and data analytics to drive a 30% increase in customer acquisition.
          </p>

            I realized that my true passion wasn't just in the product, but in the intelligence behind it.
          </p>
          <p>
            That curiosity led me to a Master's in Data Science and a deep dive into Large Language Models. Now, instead of optimizing crop yields, I optimize multi-agent workflows. I bring the grit of a business owner and the rigor of a data scientist to every product I build.
